[00:12.53] Oh, my love, my darling
[00:19.34] I've hungered for your touch
[00:23.84] A long lonely time
[00:32.84] 
[00:32.23] Time goes by so slowly
[00:40.49] And time can do so much
[00:44.99] Are you still mine?
[00:51.40] I need your love, I need your love
[01:04.86] God speed your love to me
[01:17.36] 
[01:16.47] Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
[01:23.64] To the open arms of the sea
[01:32.44] Lonely rivers cry, wait for me, wait for me
[01:39.94] I'll be coming home, wait for me
[01:55.94] 
[01:49.02] Oh, my love, my darling
[01:54.57] I've hungered for your touch
[02:00.29] A long lonely time
[02:09.29] 
[02:30.90] I need your love, I need your love
[02:47.64] God speed your love to me
[03:00.14] 
[03:18.70] Thank you
